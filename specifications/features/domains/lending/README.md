# Loan Top-up Feature: Multi-DSL Implementation

This directory contains the Loan Top-up feature implementation using our multi-layered Domain-Specific Language (DSL) approach.

## Overview

The Loan Top-up journey allows existing loan customers to borrow additional funds on their current loan without going through a full application process. This creates a streamlined, friction-free experience while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

## The Three DSL Layers

Our implementation uses three complementary layers:

### Layer 1: Behavior Specification (.feature)

[loan-topup.feature](loan-topup.feature) contains user-focused scenarios written in Gherkin syntax. These scenarios define what the application should do from a business perspective, serving as:

- Executable requirements documentation
- Acceptance criteria for development
- Test scenarios for validation

Example:
```gherkin
Scenario: Customer in Hong Kong sees regional regulatory information
  Given I am authenticated in the mobile banking app
  And I have an existing loan that is eligible for top-up
  And my current region is set to "HK"
  When I navigate to the "My Loans" section
  Then I should see all monetary values in "HKD" format
  And I should see the regulatory information specific to "HK" including:
    | HKMA approval notice | Cooling-off period | Risk disclosure |
```

### Layer 2: Test Implementation DSL (.clj)

[loan_topup_example.clj](../../../dsl/functional-clj/domains/lending/loan_topup_example.clj) implements a sophisticated functional programming model inspired by SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) principles. This DSL:

- Defines an evaluator for business rules and expressions
- Implements business rules as expressions
- Provides region and segment-specific calculations
- Handles time-sensitive content logic
- Powers the test validation through a clean abstraction layer

Key concepts in this implementation:
- Expression types (variables, applications, lambdas, conditionals)
- Environment model with frames and bindings
- Business rule constructors with condition/action pairs
- Domain-specific primitives for regions and customer segments

### Layer 3: UI/UX Specification DSL (.finapp)

[loan-topup.finapp](../../../dsl/finapp/domains/lending/loan-topup.finapp) provides a declarative specification of the user interface, screens, and interactions. This format:

- Defines screens, components, and layouts
- Specifies data models and validation rules
- Declares navigation flows and transitions
- Configures API endpoints and contracts
- Handles regional variations and localizations

This specification can be consumed by development teams to implement the feature consistently across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

## Technical Deep Dive: Functional DSL

### Core Architecture

The functional DSL follows a lambda calculus-inspired approach:

1. **Expression Representation**: All business logic is represented as data structures (not just code):
   ```clojure
   ;; Example of a lambda expression in our DSL
   (def calculate-new-monthly-payment 
     (core/make-lambda
       ["currentBalance" "topupAmount" "interestRate" "remainingTerm"]
       (core/make-application
         (core/make-variable "calculatePayment")
         [(core/make-application
            (core/make-variable "+")
            [(core/make-variable "currentBalance") 
             (core/make-variable "topupAmount")])
          (core/make-variable "interestRate")
          (core/make-variable "remainingTerm")])))
   ```

2. **Evaluator Implementation**: The DSL includes a full evaluator that processes these expressions:
   ```clojure
   ;; Core evaluation function (simplified)
   (defn evaluate [expression environment]
     (cond
       (self-evaluating? expression) expression
       (variable? expression) (lookup-variable-value (:name expression) environment)
       (application? expression)
         (let [procedure (evaluate (:operator expression) environment)
               args (map #(evaluate % environment) (:operands expression))]
           (apply-procedure procedure args))
       ;; Other expression types handled similarly...
       ))
   ```

3. **Environment Model**: The DSL uses lexical scoping with frames and bindings:
   ```clojure
   ;; Environment operations
   (defn extend-environment [variables values base-env]
     {:frame (make-frame variables values)
      :parent base-env})
   
   (defn lookup-variable-value [variable env]
     (if (nil? env)
       (throw (Exception. (str "Unbound variable: " variable)))
       (if (contains? (:frame env) variable)
         (get-in env [:frame variable])
         (lookup-variable-value variable (:parent env)))))
   ```

### Domain-Specific Components

The DSL defines banking domain concepts as first-class objects:

1. **Regions**:
   ```clojure
   (def uk-region
     (core/make-region "UK"
       {:currency "GBP"
        :currencySymbol "Â£"
        :dateFormat "DD/MM/YYYY"
        :regulatoryBody "FCA"
        :coolingOffPeriod 14
        :language "en-GB"
        :translationsKey "uk_translations"}))
   ```

2. **Customer Segments**:
   ```clojure
   (def wealth-segment
     (core/make-customer-segment "Wealth"
       {:description "Premier or priority banking customers with higher value accounts"
        :interestRates
          {"UK" 5.4
           "HK" 5.8}
        :minTopupAmounts
          {"UK" 5000
           "HK" 50000}
        :maxTopupAmounts
          {"UK" 100000
           "HK" 800000}
        :benefits
          {"UK" ["Preferential rates" "Dedicated relationship manager" "Fee waivers"]
           "HK" ["Priority processing" "Jade status points" "Fee waivers"]}}))
   ```

3. **Business Rules**:
   ```clojure
   (def topup-amount-limits-rule
     (core/make-business-rule
       "BR001"
       ;; Condition expression
       (core/make-lambda
         ["customer" "region" "amount"]
         ;; ... condition implementation ...
       )
       ;; Action expression
       (core/make-lambda
         ["customer" "region" "amount"]
         ;; ... action implementation ...
       )
       {:description "Top-up amount must be between the minimum and maximum pre-approved limits"
        :rationale "Ensures the additional borrowing is within affordability parameters"
        :errorMessageKey "amount_limit_error"}))
   ```

4. **Screen Renderers**:
   ```clojure
   (def render-amount-selection-screen
     (core/make-lambda
       ["customer" "region" "currentDateTime"]
       (core/make-sequence
         [;; Get customer segment
          (core/make-assignment
            (core/make-variable "segment")
            (core/make-application 
              (core/make-variable "getCustomerSegment") 
              [(core/make-variable "customer")]))
          
          ;; Additional expressions...
          
          ;; Return composed screen data
          (core/make-quoted
            {:amountOptions (core/make-variable "amountOptions")
             :minAmount (core/make-variable "minAmount")
             :maxAmount (core/make-variable "maxAmount")
             :timeBasedContent (core/make-variable "timeBasedContent")
             :specialOffers (core/make-variable "specialOffers")
             :localizedText (core/make-variable "localizedText")})])))
   ```

### Integration with Test Framework

The DSL connects to test fixtures through a carefully designed interface:

1. **Environment Initialization**:
   ```clojure
   ;; In loan-topup-steps.clj
   (Given "I have an existing loan that is eligible for top-up" 
     (fn []
       ;; Set up test data
       (def existing-loan
         {:id "LOAN123456"
          :currentBalance 10000
          :originalAmount 15000
          :monthlyPayment 250
          :remainingTerm 48
          :interestRate 5.9})
       
       (loans-overview-page/setup-test-loan existing-loan)
       
       ;; Add loan to DSL environment
       (core/define-variable! "currentLoan" existing-loan dsl-environment)))
   ```

2. **Expression Evaluation for Assertions**:
   ```clojure
   (Then "I should see a localised pre-approved message in the appropriate language" 
     (fn []
       (let [visible-message (loans-overview-page/get-topup-offer-message)
             
             ;; Evaluate the expected message using the DSL
             screen-content (core/evaluate
                              (get-in loan-topup-journey [:initialOfferScreen])
                              dsl-environment)]
         
         ;; Verify using the DSL-generated content
         (is (string/includes? 
               visible-message 
               (get-in screen-content [:localizedText :pre_approved_message]))))))
   ```

### Cross-Platform Testing Architecture

Our testing infrastructure supports multiple platforms while using the same functional DSL:

1. **Base Page Object**:
   ```clojure
   (defprotocol LoanTopupPage
     ;; Abstract methods to be implemented by platform-specific implementations
     (get-amount-options [this])
     (select-amount [this amount])
     
     ;; Shared methods that use the platform-specific implementations
     (select-preset-amount [this index]
       (let [options (get-amount-options this)]
         (select-amount this (nth options index)))))
   ```

2. **Platform-Specific Implementations**:
   ```clojure
   ;; Platform-Specific Implementations
   ;; iOS implementation
   (defrecord IOSLoanTopupPage []
     LoanTopupPage
     (get-amount-options [this]
       (map #(.getText %)
         (.findElements driver ios-amount-option-selector)))
     
     (select-amount [this amount]
       ;; iOS-specific implementation
       ))

   ;; Android implementation
   (defrecord AndroidLoanTopupPage []
     LoanTopupPage
     (get-amount-options [this]
       (map #(.getText %)
         (.findElements driver android-amount-option-selector)))
     
     (select-amount [this amount]
       ;; Android-specific implementation
       ))
   ```

3. **Platform Determination Logic**:
   ```clojure
   ;; Factory function to get the right page object
   (defn get-loan-topup-page []
     (case config/platform
       "ios" (->IOSLoanTopupPage)
       "android" (->AndroidLoanTopupPage)
       "web" (->WebLoanTopupPage)))

   ;; Used in step definitions
   (def loan-topup-page (get-loan-topup-page))
   ```

## Code Generation from .finapp to Platform-Specific Code

The `.finapp` file serves as the source for code generation across platforms:

### 1. Code Generation Pipeline

1. **Parsing**: The `.finapp` file is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
2. **Analysis**: The AST is analyzed for completeness and correctness
3. **Transformation**: The AST is transformed into platform-specific code models
4. **Generation**: Code files are generated for each target platform

### 2. iOS Example (Swift)

```swift
// Generated from screen TopupAmountSelection in loan-topup.finapp
class TopupAmountSelectionViewController: UIViewController {
    // Properties for screen parameters
    var loanId: String
    var offerId: String
    
    // Data formatting functions
    func formatCurrency(value: Double, region: String) -> String {
        return region == "UK" ? "Â£\(String(format: "%.2f", value))" : "HK$\(String(format: "%.2f", value))"
    }
    
    func getPresetAmounts(minAmount: Double, maxAmount: Double, segment: String) -> [Double] {
        let spread = maxAmount - minAmount
        let step = spread / 4
        return [
            round(minAmount + step),
            round(minAmount + step * 2),
            round(minAmount + step * 3)
        ]
    }
    
    // UI components and layout
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Android Example (Kotlin)

```kotlin
// Generated from screen TopupAmountSelection in loan-topup.finapp
@Composable
fun TopupAmountSelectionScreen(
    loanId: String,
    offerId: String,
    onContinue: (amount: Double) -> Unit,
    onBack: () -> Unit
) {
    // State management
    var selectedAmount by remember { mutableStateOf<Double?>(null) }
    var customAmount by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
    var newMonthlyPayment by remember { mutableStateOf<Double?>(null) }
    
    // Data functions
    fun formatCurrency(value: Double, region: String): String {
        return if (region == "UK") "Â£${value.format(2)}" else "HK$${value.format(2)}"
    }
    
    // UI Components
    Column {
        // Header
        Text(
            text = "Select Top-up Amount",
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.h5
        )
        
        // Layout components
        // ...
    }
}
```

### 4. Web Example (React/TypeScript)

```tsx
// Generated from screen TopupAmountSelection in loan-topup.finapp
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface TopupAmountSelectionProps {
  loanId: string;
  offerId: string;
  onContinue: (amount: number) => void;
  onBack: () => void;
}

export const TopupAmountSelection: React.FC<TopupAmountSelectionProps> = ({
  loanId,
  offerId,
  onContinue,
  onBack
}) => {
  // State
  const [selectedAmount, setSelectedAmount] = useState<number | null>(null);
  const [customAmount, setCustomAmount] = useState(false);
  const [newMonthlyPayment, setNewMonthlyPayment] = useState<number | null>(null);
  
  // Data functions
  const formatCurrency = (value: number, region: string): string => {
    return region === 'UK' ? `Â£${value.toFixed(2)}` : `HK$${value.toFixed(2)}`;
  };
  
  // Component rendering
  return (
    <div className="screen-container">
      {/* Header */}
      <h2>Select Top-up Amount</h2>
      
      {/* Content */}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Regional and Segment Considerations

The Loan Top-up implementation handles variations across:

### Regions
- **United Kingdom**: FCA regulations, GBP currency, UK-specific disclosures
- **Hong Kong**: HKMA regulations, HKD currency, HK-specific disclosures

### Customer Segments
- **Basic**: Standard interest rates and limits
- **Wealth**: Premium interest rates, higher limits, additional benefits

### Time-sensitive Processing
- Standard business hours: Immediate processing
- Evening/weekend hours: Modified processing timeframes
- Holiday periods: Special handling and notifications

## Integration with Core System

The Loan Top-up feature integrates with the core banking system through:

1. **API Contracts**: Defined in the `.finapp` file under the `api` section
2. **Data Models**: Shared between the DSL and the core system
3. **Authentication**: Leveraging the core authentication framework
4. **Error Handling**: Following the centralized error management patterns

## Getting Started with Development

To work with this feature:

1. **Understand the DSLs**: Review all three DSL files to understand the feature
2. **Run the Tests**: Execute the BDD scenarios to see expected behavior
3. **Modify Specifications**: Make changes to the DSLs when requirements change
4. **Generate Code**: Use the Code Generation Engine to create platform code
5. **Validate Implementation**: Run tests against the implemented feature

## Using This Approach for Other Features

This multi-layered DSL approach can be applied to other financial features that require:
- Regional adaptations
- Customer segmentation
- Complex business rules
- Sophisticated UI/UX specifications

It provides a blueprint for creating maintainable, cross-platform specifications that serve both business and technical stakeholders.
